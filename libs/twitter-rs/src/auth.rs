/// A token that can be used to sign requests to Twitter.
///
/// # Authenticating Requests With Twitter
///
/// A Token is given at the end of the authentication process, and is what you use to authenticate
/// every other call you make with Twitter. The process is different depending on whether you're
/// wanting to operate on behalf of a user, and on how easily your application can open a web
/// browser and/or redirect web requests to and from Twitter. For more information, see Twitter's
/// [OAuth documentation overview][OAuth].
///
/// [OAuth]: https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview
///
/// The very first thing you'll need to do to get access to the Twitter API is to head to
/// [Twitter's Application Manager][twitter-apps] and create an app. Once you've done that, there
/// are two sets of keys immediately available to you. First are the "consumer key" and "consumer
/// secret", that are used to represent you as the application author when signing requests. These
/// keys are given to every single API call regardless of permission level. Related are an "access
/// token" and "access token secret", that can be used to skip the authentication steps if you're
/// only interacting with your own account or with no account in particular. Generally, if you want
/// to read or write to a particular user's stream, you'll need to request authorization and get an
/// access token to work on their behalf.
///
/// [twitter-apps]: https://apps.twitter.com/
///
/// ## Access Tokens
///
/// Access tokens are for when you want to perform your requests on behalf of a specific user. This
/// could be for something like posting to their account, reading their home timeline, viewing
/// protected accounts they follow, and other actions that only make sense from the perspective
/// from a specific user. Because of the two-fold nature of making sure your requests are signed
/// from your specific *app* and from that specific *user*, the authentication process for access
/// tokens is fairly complicated.
///
/// The process to get an access token for a specific user (with this library) has three basic
/// steps:
///
/// 1. Log your request with Twitter by getting a [request token][].
/// 2. Direct the user to grant permission to your application by sending them to an
///    [authenticate][] or [authorize][] URL, depending on the nature of your app.
/// 3. Convert the verifier given by the permission request into an [access token][].
///
/// [request token]: fn.request_token.html
/// [authorize]: fn.authorize_url.html
/// [authenticate]: fn.authenticate_url.html
/// [access token]: fn.access_token.html
///
/// Before you get too deep into the authentication process, it helps to know a couple things about
/// the app you're writing:
///
/// * Is your app in an environment where directing users to and from a web page is easy? (e.g. a
///   website, or a mobile app)
/// * Are you using Twitter authentication as a substitute for user accounts, instead of just to
///   interact with their Twitter account?
///
/// Depending on your answer to the first question, you may need to use "PIN-Based Authorization",
/// where the user completes the authentication/authorization process in a separate window and
/// receives a numeric PIN in response that your app can use to complete the authentication
/// process. The alternative to that is the standard OAuth flow, where a web browser is directed to
/// Twitter to complete the login and authorization, then redirected back to your app to receive
/// the access token proper. The way to signal one method or another is by the `callback` parameter
/// to the [access token] request.
///
/// The second question informs *where* you send the user to authorize your app. Using the "Sign In
/// With Twitter" flow, your app could be able to transparently request another access token
/// without the user needing to accept the connection every time. This is ideal for websites where
/// a "Sign In With Twitter" button could replace a regular login button, instead using a user's
/// Twitter account in place for regular username/password credentials. To be able to use the "Sign
/// In With Twitter" flow, you must first enable it for your app on Twitter's Application Manager.
/// Then, for Step 2 of the authentication process, send the user to an [authenticate] URL.
///
/// The primary difference between the different URLs for Step 2 is that an [authenticate] URL
/// allows the above behavior, whereas an [authorize] URL does not require the extra setting in the
/// app manager and always requires the user to re-authorize the app every time they're sent
/// through the authentication process. As access tokens can be cached indefinitely until the app's
/// access is revoked, this is not necessarily as onerous as it sounds.
///
/// The end result of Step 2 is that your app receives a "verifier" to vouch for the user's
/// acceptance of your app. With PIN-Based Authorization, the user receives a PIN from Twitter that
/// acts as the verifier. With "Sign In With Twitter" and its counterpart, "3-Legged
/// Authorization", the verifier is given as a query parameter to the callback URL given back in
/// Step 1. With this verifier and the original request token, you can combine them with your app's
/// consumer token to get the [access token] that opens up the rest of the Twitter API.
///
/// ### Example (Access Token)
///
/// For "PIN-Based Authorization":
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// let con_token = egg_mode::KeyPair::new("consumer key", "consumer secret");
/// // "oob" is needed for PIN-based auth; see docs for `request_token` for more info
/// let request_token = egg_mode::request_token(&con_token, "oob").unwrap();
/// let auth_url = egg_mode::authorize_url(&request_token);
///
/// // give auth_url to the user, they can sign in to Twitter and accept your app's permissions.
/// // they'll receive a PIN in return, they need to give this to your application
///
/// let verifier = "123456"; //read the PIN from the user here
///
/// // note this consumes con_token; if you want to sign in multiple accounts, clone it here
/// let (token, user_id, screen_name) =
///     egg_mode::access_token(con_token, &request_token, verifier).unwrap();
///
/// // token can be given to any egg_mode method that asks for a token
/// // user_id and screen_name refer to the user who signed in
/// ```
///
/// **WARNING**: The consumer token and preset access token mentioned below are as privileged as
/// passwords! If your consumer key pair leaks or is visible to the public, anyone can impersonate
/// your app! If you use a fixed token for your app, it's recommended to set them in separate files
/// and use `include_str!()` (from the standard library) to load them in, so you can safely exclude
/// them from source control.
///
/// ### Shortcut: Pre-Generated Access Token
///
/// If you only want to sign in as yourself, you can skip the request token authentication flow
/// entirely and instead use the access token key pair given alongside your app keys:
///
/// ```rust
/// let con_token = egg_mode::KeyPair::new("consumer key", "consumer secret");
/// let access_token = egg_mode::KeyPair::new("access token key", "access token secret");
/// let token = egg_mode::Token::Access {
///     consumer: con_token,
///     access: access_token,
/// };
///
/// // token can be given to any egg_mode method that asks for a token
/// ```
///
/// ## Bearer Tokens
///
/// Bearer tokens are for when you want to perform requests on behalf of your app itself, instead
/// of a specific user. Bearer tokens are the API equivalent of viewing Twitter from a logged-out
/// session. Anything that's already public can be viewed, but things like protected users or the
/// home timeline can't be accessed with bearer tokens. On the other hand, because you don't need
/// to authenticate a user, obtaining a bearer token is relatively simple.
///
/// If a Bearer token will work for your purposes, use the following steps to get a Token:
///
/// 1. With the consumer key/secret obtained the same way as above, ask Twitter for the current
///    [Bearer token] for your application.
///
/// [Bearer token]: fn.bearer_token.html
///
/// And... that's it! This Bearer token can be cached and saved for future use. It will not expire
/// until you ask Twitter to [invalidate] the token for you. Otherwise, this token can be used the
/// same way as the [access token] from earlier, but with the restrictions mentioned above.
///
/// [invalidate]: fn.invalidate_bearer.html
///
/// ### Example (Bearer Token)
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// let con_token = egg_mode::KeyPair::new("consumer key", "consumer secret");
/// let token = egg_mode::bearer_token(&con_token).unwrap();
///
/// // token can be given to *most* egg_mode methods that ask for a token
/// // for restrictions, see docs for bearer_token
/// ```

/// direct messages, viewing protected user profiles, functions like `tweet::home_timeline` that
/// operate in terms of the authenticated user - will not work with just a Bearer token. Attempts
/// to perform those actions will return an authentication error.
///
/// Other things to note about Bearer tokens:
///
/// - Bearer tokens have a higher rate limit for the methods they can be used on, compared to
///   regular Access tokens.
/// - The bearer token returned by Twitter is the same token each time you call it. It can be
///   cached and reused as long as you need it.
/// - Since a Bearer token can be used to directly authenticate calls to Twitter, it should be
///   treated with the same sensitivity as a password. If you believe your Bearer token to be
///   compromised, call [`invalidate_bearer`] with your consumer KeyPair and the Bearer token you
///   need to invalidate.  This will cause Twitter to generate a new Bearer token for your
///   application, which will be returned the next time you call this function.
