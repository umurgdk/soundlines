///Represents a paginated list of results, such as the users who follow a specific user or the

///
///```rust,no_run
///# let token = egg_mode::Token::Access {
///#     consumer: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
///#     access: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
///# };
///for name in egg_mode::user::followers_of("rustlang", &token)
///                                        .map(|u| u.unwrap().response.screen_name).take(10) {
///    println!("{}", name);
///}
///```
///
///You can even collect the results, letting you get one set of rate-limit information for the
///entire search setup:
///
///```rust,no_run
///# let token = egg_mode::Token::Access {
///#     consumer: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
///#     access: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
///# };
///use egg_mode::Response;
///use egg_mode::user::TwitterUser;
///use egg_mode::error::Error;
///
///let names: Result<Response<Vec<TwitterUser>>, Error> =
///    egg_mode::user::followers_of("rustlang", &token).take(10).collect();
///```
///
///`CursorIter` has a couple adaptors of its own that you can use before consuming it.
///`with_page_size` will let you set how many users are pulled in with a single network call, and
///`start_at_page` lets you start your search at a specific page. Calling either of these after
///starting iteration will clear any current results.
///
///(A note about `with_page_size`/`page_size`: While the `CursorIter` struct always has this method
///and field available, not every cursored call supports changing page size. Check the individual
///method documentation for notes on what page sizes are allowed.)
///
///The type returned by the iterator is `Result<Response<T::Item>, Error>`, so network errors,
///rate-limit errors and other issues are passed directly through to `next()`. This also means that
///getting an error while iterating doesn't mean you're at the end of the list; you can wait for
///the network connection to return or for the rate limit to refresh before trying again.
///
///## Manual paging
///
///The iterator works by lazily loading a page of results at a time (with size set by
///`with_page_size` or by directly assigning `page_size` for applicable calls) in the background
///whenever you ask for the next result. This can be nice, but it also means that you can lose
///track of when your loop will block for the next page of results. This is where the extra fields
///and methods on `UserSearch` come in. By using `call()`, you can get the cursor struct directly
///from Twitter.  With that you can iterate over the results and page forward and backward as
///needed:
///
///```rust,no_run
///# let token = egg_mode::Token::Access {
///#     consumer: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
///#     access: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
///# };
///let mut list = egg_mode::user::followers_of("rustlang", &token).with_page_size(20);
///let resp = list.call().unwrap();
///
///for user in resp.response.users {
///    println!("{} (@{})", user.name, user.screen_name);
///}
///
///list.next_cursor = resp.response.next_cursor;
///let resp = list.call().unwrap();
///
///for user in resp.response.users {
///    println!("{} (@{})", user.name, user.screen_name);
///}
///```
