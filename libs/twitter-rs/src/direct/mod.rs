//! Structs and methods for working with direct messages.
//!
//! Note that direct message access requires a special permissions level above regular read/write
//! access. Your app must be configured to have "read, write, and direct message" access to use any
//! function in this module, even the read-only ones.
//!
//! Although the Twitter website and official apps display DMs as threads between the authenticated
//! user and specific other users, the API does not expose them like this. Separate calls to
//! `received` and `sent` are necessary to fully reconstruct a DM thread. You can partition on
//! `sender_id`/`receiver_id` and sort by their `created_at` to weave the streams together.
//!
//! ## Types
//!
//! * `DirectMessage`/`DMEntities`: A single DM and its associated entities. The `DMEntities`
//!   struct contains information about URLs, user mentions, and hashtags in the DM.
//! * `Timeline`: Effectively the same as `tweet::Timeline`, but returns `DirectMessage`s instead.
//!   Returned by functions that traverse collections of DMs.
//! * `ConversationTimeline`/`DMConversations`: This struct and alias are part of the
//!   "conversations" wrapper for loading direct messages into per-recipient threads.
//!
//! ## Functions
//!
//! ### Lookup
//!
//! These functions pull a user's DMs for viewing. `sent` and `received` can be cursored with
//! sub-views like with tweets, so they return a `Timeline` instance that can be navigated at will.
//!
//! * `sent`
//! * `received`
//! * `show`
//! * `conversations`
//!
//! ### Actions
//!
//! These functions are your basic write access to DMs. As a DM does not carry as much metadata as
//! a tweet, the `send` action does not go through a builder struct like with `DraftTweet`.
//!
//! * `send`
//! * `delete`

/// Helper struct to navigate collections of direct messages by requesting DMs older or newer than

///
/// Using a Timeline to navigate collections of DMs allows you to efficiently cursor through a
/// collection and only load in the messages you need.
///
/// To begin, call a method that returns a `Timeline`, optionally set the page size, and call
/// `start` to load the first page of results:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # let token = egg_mode::Token::Access {
/// #     consumer: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
/// #     access: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
/// # };
/// let mut timeline = egg_mode::direct::received(&token)
///                                .with_page_size(10);
///
/// for dm in &timeline.start().unwrap().response {
///     println!("<@{}> {}", dm.sender_screen_name, dm.text);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// If you need to load the next set of messages, call `older`, which will automatically update the
/// IDs it tracks:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # let token = egg_mode::Token::Access {
/// #     consumer: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
/// #     access: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
/// # };
/// # let mut timeline = egg_mode::direct::received(&token);
/// # timeline.start().unwrap();
/// for dm in &timeline.older(None).unwrap().response {
///     println!("<@{}> {}", dm.sender_screen_name, dm.text);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ...and similarly for `newer`, which operates in a similar fashion.
///
/// If you want to start afresh and reload the newest set of DMs again, you can call `start` again,
/// which will clear the tracked IDs before loading the newest set of messages. However, if you've
/// been storing these messages as you go, and already know the newest ID you have on hand, you can
/// load only those messages you need like this:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # let token = egg_mode::Token::Access {
/// #     consumer: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
/// #     access: egg_mode::KeyPair::new("", ""),
/// # };
/// let mut timeline = egg_mode::direct::received(&token)
///                                .with_page_size(10);
///
/// timeline.start().unwrap();
///
/// //keep the max_id for later
/// let reload_id = timeline.max_id.unwrap();
///
/// //simulate scrolling down a little bit
/// timeline.older(None).unwrap();
/// timeline.older(None).unwrap();
///
/// //reload the timeline with only what's new
/// timeline.reset();
/// timeline.older(Some(reload_id)).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// Here, the argument to `older` means "older than what I just returned, but newer than the given
/// ID". Since we cleared the tracked IDs with `reset`, that turns into "the newest DMs available
/// that were sent after the given ID". The earlier invocations of `older` with `None` do not place
/// a bound on the DMs it loads. `newer` operates in a similar fashion with its argument, saying
/// "newer than what I just returned, but not newer than this given ID". When called like this,
/// it's possible for these methods to return nothing, which will also clear the `Timeline`'s
/// tracked IDs.
///
/// If you want to manually pull messages between certain IDs, the baseline `call` function can do
/// that for you. Keep in mind, though, that `call` doesn't update the `min_id` or `max_id` fields,
/// so you'll have to set those yourself if you want to follow up with `older` or `newer`.

/// This timeline loader is meant to get around a limitation of the direct message API endpoints:
/// Twitter only gives endpoints to load all the messages sent my the authenticated user, or all
/// the messages received by the authenticated user. However, the common user interface for DMs is
/// to separate them by the other account in the conversation. This loader is a higher-level
/// wrapper over the direct `sent` and `received` calls to achieve this interface without library
/// users having to implement it themselves.
///
/// Much like [`Timeline`], simply receiving a `ConversationTimeline` from `conversations` does not
/// load any messages on its own. This is to allow setting the page size before loading the first
/// batch of messages.
///
/// [`Timeline`]: struct.Timeline.html
///
/// `ConversationTimeline` keeps a cache of all the messages its loaded, and returns a reference to
/// that cache when it loads more messages. This means that every time you load more messages, you
/// get the *complete* conversations view, not just the new messages.
///
/// There are two methods to load messages, and they operate by extending the cache by loading
/// messages either older or newer than the extent of the cache.
///
/// **NOTE**: Twitter has different API limitations for sent versus received messages. You can only
/// load the most recent 200 *received* messages through the public API, but you can load up to 800
/// *sent* messages. This can create some strange user-interface if a user has some old
/// conversations, as they can only see their own side of the conversation this way. If you'd like
/// to load as many messages as possible, both API endpoints have a per-call limit of 200. Setting
/// the page size to 200 prior to loading messages allows you to use one function call to load a
/// fairly-complete view of the user's conversations.
