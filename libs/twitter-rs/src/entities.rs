//! Data structures containing extracted URL, mention, tag, and media information.
//!
//! These structures are meant to be received in an API call to describe the data they accompany.
//! For example, a `UrlEntity` describes a hyperlink in a tweet or user description text, and a
//! `HashtagEntity` describes a hashtag or stock symbol extracted from a tweet.
//!
//! For more information on the data in these structures, see Twitter's documentation for
//! [Entities][] and [Entities in Objects][obj].
//!
//! [Entities]: https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/entities
//! [obj]: https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/entities-in-twitter-objects
//!
//! ## Entity Ranges
//!
//! Entities that refer to elements within a text have a `range` field that contains the text span
//! that is being referenced. The numbers in question are byte offsets, so if you have an entity
//! that you'd like to slice out of the source text, you can use the indices directly in slicing
//! operations:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use egg_mode::entities::HashtagEntity;
//! # let entity = HashtagEntity { range: (0, 0), text: "".to_string() };
//! # let text = "asdf";
//! let slice = &text[entity.range.0..entity.range.1];
//! ```
//!
//! ### Shortened, Display, and Expanded URLs
//!
//! URL and Media entities contain references to a URL within their parent text. However, due to
//! the nature of how Twitter handles URLs in tweets and user bios, each entity struct has three
//! URLs within it:
//!
//! - `url`: This is the `t.co` shortened URL as returned directly from twitter. This is what
//!   contributes to character count in tweets and user bios.
//! - `expanded_url`: This is the original URL the user entered in their tweet. While it is given
//!   to API client, Twitter recommends still sending users to the shortened link, for analytics
//!   purposes. Twitter Web uses this field to supply hover-text for where the URL resolves to.
//! - `display_url`: This is a truncated version of `expanded_url`, meant to be displayed inline
//!   with the parent text. This is useful to show users where the link resolves to, without
//!   potentially filling up a lot of space with the fullly expanded URL.
