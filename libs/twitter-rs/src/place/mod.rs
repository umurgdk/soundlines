//! Types and methods for looking up locations.
//!
//! Location search for Twitter works in one of two ways. The most direct method is to take a
//! latitude/longitude coordinate (say, from a devide's GPS system or by geolocating from wi-fi
//! networks, or simply from a known coordinate) and call `reverse_geocode`. Twitter says
//! `reverse_geocode` provides more of a "raw data access", and it can be considered to merely show
//! what locations are in that point or area.
//!
//! On the other hand, if you're intending to let a user select from a list of locations, you can
//! use the `search_*` methods instead. These have much of the same available parameters, but will
//! "potentially re-order [results] with regards to the user who is authenticated." In addition,
//! the results may potentially pull in "nearby" results to allow for a more broad selection or to
//! account for inaccurate location reporting.
//!
//! Since there are several optional parameters to both query methods, each one is assembled as a
//! builder. You can create the builder with the `reverse_geocode`, `search_point`, `search_query`,
//! or `search_ip` functions. From there, add any additional parameters by chaining method calls
//! onto the builder. When you're ready to peform the search call, hand your tokens to `call`, and
//! the list of results will be returned.
//!
//! Along with the list of place results, Twitter also returns the full search URL. egg-mode
//! returns this URL as part of the result struct, allowing you to perform the same search using
//! the `reverse_geocode_url` or `search_url` functions.
