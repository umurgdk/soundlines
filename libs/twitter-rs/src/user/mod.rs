//! Structs and methods for pulling user information from Twitter.
//!
//! Everything in here acts on users in some way, whether looking up user information, finding the
//! relations between two users, or actions like following or blocking a user.
//!
//! ## Types
//!
//! - `UserID`: used as a generic input to many functions, this enum allows you to refer to a user
//!   by a numeric ID or by their screen name.
//! - `Relationship`/`RelationSource`/`RelationTarget`: returned by `relation`, these types
//!   (`Relationship` contains the other two) show the ways two accounts relate to each other.
//! - `RelationLookup`/`Connection`: returned as part of a collection by `relation_lookup`, these
//!   types (`RelationLookup` contains a `Vec<Connection>`) shows the ways the authenticated user
//!   relates to a specific account.
//! - `TwitterUser`/`UserEntities`/`UserEntityDetail`: returned by many functions in this module,
//!   these types (`TwitterUser` contains the other two) describe the content of a user's profile,
//!   and a handful of settings relating to how their profile is displayed.
//! - `UserSearch`: returned by `search`, this is an iterator over search results.
//!
//! ## Functions
//!
//! ### User actions
//!
//! These functions perform actions to the user's account. Their use requires that your application
//! request write access to authenticated accounts.
//!
//! - `block`/`report_spam`/`unblock`
//! - `follow`/`unfollow`/`update_follow`
//! - `mute`/`unmute`
//!
//! ### Direct lookup
//!
//! These functions return single users, or groups of users without having to iterate over the
//! results.
//!
//! - `show`
//! - `lookup`/`lookup_ids`/`lookup_names`
//! - `friends_no_retweets`
//! - `relation`/`relation_lookup`
//!
//! ### Cursored lookup
//!
//! These functions imply that they can return more entries than Twitter is willing to return at
//! once, so they're delivered in pages. This library takes those paginated results and wraps an
//! iterator around them that loads the pages as-needed.
//!
//! - `search`
//! - `friends_of`/`friends_ids`
//! - `followers_of`/`followers_ids`
//! - `blocks`/`blocks_ids`
//! - `mutes`/`mutes_ids`
//! - `incoming_requests`/`outgoing_requests`

/// Convenience enum to generalize between referring to an account by numeric ID or by screen name.
///
/// Many API calls ask for a user either by either screen name (e.g. `rustlang`) or by a numeric ID
/// assigned to the account (e.g. `165262228`). In egg-mode, these calls are abstracted around this
/// enum, and can take any type that converts into it. This enum has `From` implementations for the
/// following types:
///
/// * `u64`
/// * `&u64` (convenient when used with iterators)
/// * `&str`
/// * `&&str` (convenient when used with iterators)
/// * `&String` (to counteract the fact that deref coercion doesn't work with generics)
/// * `&UserID` (convenient when used with iterators)
///
/// This way, when a function in egg-mode has a paremeter of type `T: Into<UserID<'a>>`, you can
/// call it with any of these types, and it will be converted automatically. egg-mode will then use
/// the proper parameter when performing the call to Twitter.

/// This struct is returned by [`search`][] and is meant to be used as an iterator. This means that

///
/// [`search`]: fn.search.html
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # let token = egg_mode::Token::Access {

///
/// You can even collect the results, letting you get one set of rate-limit information for the
/// entire search setup:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # let token = egg_mode::Token::Access {

/// the next result. This can be nice, but it also means that you can lose track of when your loop
